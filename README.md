# Article

With this extension for the OntoWiki system you can easily create, edit and maintain wiki pages. 
The focus lay on the wiki pages themself, because of that we provide a simple user interface and
an intelligent integration in the OntoWiki user interface. Article extension based on the Markdown 
markup (like in Wikipedia) and provides an easy to use BB code editor. For more information have a look
